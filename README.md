# Classification-of-Song-Genres
Over the past few years, streaming services with huge catalogs have become the primary means through which most people listen to their favorite music. But at the same time, the sheer amount of music on offer can mean users might be a bit overwhelmed when trying to look for newer music that suits their tastes. For this reason, streaming services have looked into means of categorizing music to allow for personalized recommendations. One method involves direct analysis of the raw audio information in a given song, scoring the raw data on a variety of metrics. 

This project will examine data compiled by a research group known as The Echo Nest. We will classify songs as being either 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock' - all without listening to a single one ourselves. In doing so, we will utilize the following methods:

- Data Preparation and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Visualization
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Comparison of Decision Trees vs. Logistic Regression
- K-fold Cross Validation
